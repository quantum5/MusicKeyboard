MusicKeyboard
=============

This free and open source program emulates a piano, but can use
all available MIDI instruments, instead of just the piano. You
can use this program to play almost any music you like. It also
fully supports chording, but due to the keyboard chording
limitations, only 3 - 7 keys may be pressed simultaneously,
so your milage may vary.
